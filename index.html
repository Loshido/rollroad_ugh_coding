            <p>
                Mapping applications have became necessary tools in today's 
                globalized world, offering innovative features that streamline 
                various aspects of our lives, from Real-Time Traffic Updates to 
                Local Search and Reviews. However, despite their many advancements, 
                challenges persist, particularly in the realm of route suggestion, 
                causing frustration for users worldwide.

            <h1>The original pathfinding algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                The route suggestion algorithms used in classical mapping software, such as 
                Google Maps and Bing Maps, primarily focus on recommending the shortest route, 
                with additionnal options like the cheapest or most eco-friendly route. While this approach 
                does work, it often leads to a significant problem: the 'shortest route' frequently becomes 
                the most congested and time-consuming option, resulting in longer travel times compared 
                to slightly longer but less congested routes. This issue has long been a source of 
                frustration for users

            <p>
                We employs an alternave, enhanced version of traditionnal route suggestion algorithms. 
                Initially, the algorithm computes the estimated travel time for each possible route. 
                Like the old algorithm, it suggests the shortest path. However, when the recommended 
                route begins to experience congestion, detected through data on the number of vehicles 
                and roads conditions, our algorithm takes action. It redistributes the traffic load by 
                suggesting new paths, resulting in the most efficient and well-regulated solution for all users.
